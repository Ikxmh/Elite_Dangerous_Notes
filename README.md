o7 CMDRS! I HOPE Y'ALL ARE DOING WELL--IF NOT, I WISH THE BEST DAY FOR Y'ALL THEN!                                                              
BUT YES, THIS GITHUB REPOSITORY IS A PLACE WHERE I KEEP MY NOTES FOR **ELITE DANGEROUS** SUCH AS SHIP'S SPECS TO INSTRUCTIONS.      
                                                                                                                                
IT'S MEANT FOR ME, BUT I ALSO HOPE OTHERS CAN BENEFIT IN READING THESE FILES.                                                   
I WILL KEEP ADDING/UPDATING INFORMATION AS I GAIN MORE EXPERIENCE.                                                              
                                                                                                                                
TO ENSURE THE INFO IS NOT TOO OUTDATED-- CHECK THE "LAST UPDATED;" THIS WILL HELP YOU DETERMINE IF IT IS USEFUL FOR YOUR CASE.  
                                                                                                                                
LASTLY, I WILL TRY MY BEST TO KEEP THE NOTES ORGANIZED VIA FOLDERS. FOR EXAMPLE: **_COMBAT-> SHIP COMBAT SETUPS-> EAGLE-> EAGLE SPECS_**.
